<h2>about me</h2>
<p>I am a student in MIASHS, Mathematics and Computer Science Applied to Human and Social Sciences.
My main focus is on computer science.
Over the past two years, I have developed strong skills in Python, SQL, and Excel.
To build those skills I combined structured courses with hands-on projects, solving concrete problems rather than only following tutorials.
When I hit a problem, I isolate the smallest failing step, research solutions, test alternatives, and then generalize the fix so it applies to new datasets.
This cycle of practice, debugging, and reflection made the tools work for me and let me focus on insights rather than syntax.</p>

<h1>GOALS</h1>
<h3>My main goal is to become a data analyst in the fashion industry.</h3>
<p>I want to use data not only to explain trends but also to predict them.
I aim to transform raw information into clear insights that help guide design, marketing, and customer experience.
In the long run, I hope to contribute to projects that connect technology, style, and human behavior.</p>
