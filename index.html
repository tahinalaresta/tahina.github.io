    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <div class="name">
      manie, Tahina! :)
    </div>
    <p>
      I am a student in MIASHS (Mathematics and Computer Science Applied to Human and Social Sciences), with a primary focus on computer science. Over the past two years, I have developed strong skills in Python, 
      SQL, and Excel, combining structured courses with hands-on projects. Rather than simply following tutorials, I worked on concrete problems to reinforce my understanding and apply my knowledge in practical 
      contexts.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I encounter a problem, I isolate the smallest failing step, research potential solutions, test alternatives, and then generalize the fix to apply it to new datasets. This cycle of practice, debugging, 
      and reflection has allowed me to master the tools, shifting my focus from syntax to deriving meaningful insights from the data.

    <h2>Goals</h2>
    <h3>My main goal is to become a data analyst in the fashion industry.</h3>
    <p>
      I want to use data not only to explain trends but also to predict them.
      I aim to transform raw information into clear insights that help guide design, marketing, and customer experience.
      In the long run, I hope to contribute to projects that connect technology, style, and human behavior.
